# dmp2mml
Converts one or more 4-operator FM instrument patches from **DefleMask** .DMP files into a **Professional Music Driver (PMD) Music Macro Language** (.MML) file for use in *PMD68* (Yamaha YM2151), *PMD88/PMD98* (Yamaha YM2203/YM2608), and *PMDTOWNS* (Yamaha YM2612) music files. The contents of the resulting MML file may be copied and directly pasted onto your music fileâ€™s MML source code, or you may indirectly include the output MML file into your MML music code via an `#Include` statement above every music command.
